## Code Availability

The code is currently under preparation and will be released upon paper acceptance or camera-ready submission.

Stay tuned! 

## Project Description

EcoMamba introduces a lightweight and efficient Mamba-inspired state-space model tailored for 2D medical image segmentation. The design focuses on minimizing computational cost (GFLOPs) while maintaining high segmentation performance on benchmark datasets like ISIC 2018 and BTCV.

Key contributions:
- EcoMamba blocks with depthwise convolution
- Efficient attention block

## ðŸ“Š Datasets

We used the following datasets:
- [ISIC 2018](https://challenge2018.isic-archive.com/)
- [BTCV](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3193805/wiki/217789)

Instructions to download and preprocess datasets will be included with the final release.
